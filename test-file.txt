Hey I done some changes after commiting the empty file and after doing push
operation.
so again I should add,commit and push the file.
Now i am doing changes through Git Hub website so I should commit the changes in Git Hub and again we should do pull operation to reflect the changes in local file present in our local directory.
command should be used is:
git pull
